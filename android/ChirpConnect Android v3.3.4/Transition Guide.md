# Transition guide for Chirp Connect SDK v3.3.4 from Android SDK v2.5.2

## Overall changes
* The SDK can now work completely offline if you have a licence file.
* Chirp with associated data has been removed and is no longer available.
* The Chirp is now called a payload and it is represented by a `byte[]` array which can have a dynamic length with a maximum length defined by your protocol.



## Changes in SDK code
* All old dependencies were removed and a new dependency `com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.9.0` was added.
``` java
compile 'io.chirp.connect:chirp-connect:3.3.4-release@aar'
compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.9.0'
```



* Package imports are updated. New minimal dependencies required look like this:
``` java
import io.chirp.connect.ChirpConnect;
import io.chirp.connect.interfaces.ConnectEventListener;
import io.chirp.connect.interfaces.ConnectAuthenticationStateListener;
import io.chirp.connect.models.ChirpError;
import io.chirp.connect.models.ConnectState;
```



* SDK initialisation has been change as well. 


```java
chirpConnect = new ChirpConnect(this, APP_KEY, APP_SECRET);
```

Licence was introduced in new SDK wich contains the protocol information.  Use the following to set the licence.

```java
ChirpError setLicenceError = chirpConnect.setLicence(LICENCE);
if (setLicenceError.getCode() > 0) {
    Log.e("ChirpError:", setLicenceError.getMessage());
}
```

Or you can use the dynamic licence loading  if you want to be able to control the licence from the Admin Centre.

```java
chirpConnect.getLicence(new ConnectLicenceListener() {

    @Override
    public void onSuccess(String networkLicence) {
        Log.d("getLicence", "onSuccess");
        ChirpError setLicenceError = chirpConnect.setLicence(networkLicence);
        if (setLicenceError.getCode() > 0) {
            Log.e("ChirpError:", setLicenceError.getMessage());
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(ChirpError chirpError) {
        Log.e("getLicence", chirpError.getMessage());
    }
});
```



* The callback interface has changed as well. The interface is now called `ConnectEventListener` and have the following implementation:

```java
chirpConnect.setListener(new ConnectEventListener() {

  @Override
  public void onSent(byte[] payload) {
    Log.v("chirpConnectDemoApp", "This is called when a payload has been sent " + payload);
  }

  @Override
  public void onSending(byte[] payload) {
    Log.v("chirpConnectDemoApp", "This is called when a payload is being sent " + payload);
  }

  @Override
  public void onReceived(byte[] payload) {
    Log.v("chirpConnectDemoApp", "This is called when a payload has been received " + payload);
  }

  @Override
  public void onReceiving() {
    Log.v("chirpConnectDemoApp", "This is called when the SDK is expecting a payload to be received");
  }

  @Override
  public void onStateChanged(byte oldState, byte newState) {
    Log.v("chirpConnectDemoApp", "This is called when the SDK state has changed " + oldState + " -> " + newState);
  }

  @Override
  public void onSystemVolumeChanged(int old, int current) {
    Log.d("chirpConnectDemoApp", "This is called when the Android system volume has changed " + old + " -> " + current);
  }

});
```



* To start and stop audio processing loop you should call the same `.start()` and `.stop()` method except now it needs to be called on the new `chirpConnect` instance.
```java
chirpConnect.start();    //to start audio processing
chirpConnect.stop();    //to stop audio processing
```



* The `.chirp()` method that sends the data is now called `.send()` and you have to pass a byte array instead of a string. The size of the payload can be dynamic which will make your chirp shorter for smaller payloads however there is a maximum size that you can send and it is defined by your licence. The maximum payload length is returned by the `.getMaxPayloadLength()` method.
```java
long maxLength = chirpConnect.getMaxPayloadLength();
byte[] payload = chirpConnect.randomPayload(maxLength);
chirpConnect.send(payload);
```

For convenience here are two functions that converts a string to byte-array and a byte-array to string.

```java
public static byte[] stringToByteArray(String s) {
	return s.getBytes(StandardCharsets.US_ASCII);
}
```
```java
public static String bytesToString(byte[] byteArray) {
    return new String(byteArray, StandardCharsets.US_ASCII)
}
```

* Create a chirp with JSON data is not longer available in the SDK. Alternatively, if you need to map a payload to a JSON Object you can use a cloud service such as Firebase. See [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/) for more details.
